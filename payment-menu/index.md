## Prerequisites

To start integrating Swedbank Pay Payment Menu, you need the following:

* [HTTPS][https] enabled web server.
* Agreement that includes Swedbank Pay Payment Menu.
* Obtained credentials (merchant Access Token) from Swedbank Pay through
  Swedbank Pay Admin. Please observe that Swedbank Pay Checkout encompass
  both the **`consumer`** and **`paymentmenu`** scope.

## Introduction

To get started with Swedbank Pay Checkout, you should learn about its different
components and how they work together. **Payment Menu** authorizes the
payment with our Payment Menu API. The next step is to **Capture** the payment.
You can either capture the total amount, or do a part-capture (as described
under [After Payment][after-payment-capture]). Connect these steps and you have
Swedbank Pay Checkout.

Under, you will see a sequence diagram showing the sequence of a Swedbank Pay
Payment Menu.
